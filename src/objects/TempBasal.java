// The TempBasal object holds information about TempBasals that were given. The 'created_at' refers to the date and time that the temp basal
// was created at. The 'rate' refers to the amount of insulin delivered in a one hour period. The 'duration' states how long the TempBasal
// should have lasted. However, sometimes (but not usually) the duration is incorrect. When a TempBasal is uploaded to Nightscout, the initial
// duration is something like 30 minutes. When the TempBasal ends, NightScout is supposed to update the duration to match how long the TempBasal
// actually lasted. Sometimes, this doesn't happen, and so the duration stays on 30 minutes (or whatever the initial duration was), and so the
// duration held within this object is incorrect.
